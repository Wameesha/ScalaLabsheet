Scala Labsheets ‚Äì University Coursework

This repository contains a collection of Scala labsheets completed as part of my coursework at the University of Colombo School of Computing (UCSC).

üìö Overview

These labsheets cover a wide range of fundamental and advanced Scala programming concepts, including:

- Functional Programming (map, filter, reduce, lambdas)
- Data Structures (Lists, Tuples, Case Classes)
- Pattern Matching
- Object-Oriented Programming in Scala
- File Handling
- Concurrency with Actors
- Custom Data Types (e.g., Rational numbers, Accounts)
- Real-world problem solving with Scala

Each labsheet consists of one or more Scala files demonstrating core concepts and problem-solving approaches.
